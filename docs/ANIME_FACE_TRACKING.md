# Anime Face Tracking Reference

This document provides information about the anime face tracking repository that can be used in conjunction with the stereOgram SBS Converter for enhanced anime 3D conversion.

## Repository Reference

The anime face tracking technology referenced in this project is based on [anime-face-detector](https://github.com/hysts/anime-face-detector), a specialized face detection model trained specifically for anime-style artwork and animations.

## What It Does

Unlike general-purpose face detection models that work well with real human faces but struggle with anime-style faces, the anime-face-detector is specifically designed to:

1. Detect anime-style faces with high accuracy
2. Work with a variety of art styles and character designs
3. Identify facial landmarks in anime characters
4. Handle occlusions, unusual angles, and stylized features

## Integration with stereOgram SBS Converter

The stereOgram SBS Converter can utilize anime face detection for:

- Improved depth map generation for anime content
- Better focus points for stereoscopic conversion
- More accurate foreground/background separation in anime scenes
- Enhanced facial detail preservation in the converted 3D output

## How to Use with This Project

When processing anime content with the stereOgram SBS Converter:

1. The converter will automatically attempt to detect if the content contains anime-style artwork
2. It will apply specialized parameters optimized for anime conversion
3. Face regions will receive special depth attention for more natural 3D effect
4. Character outlines and features will be preserved in the stereoscopic output

## Advanced Integration

For users who want to enhance anime-specific processing further:

```bash
python stereogram_main.py --input your_anime_image.jpg --mode image --anime_optimization true
```

The `--anime_optimization` flag enables additional processing steps specifically for anime content, including:

- Enhanced line preservation
- Character silhouette optimization
- Special handling of flat color regions common in anime
- Depth adjustment for typical anime composition

## Limitations

The anime face detection has some limitations to be aware of:

- Very stylized or non-standard anime art styles may have reduced detection accuracy
- Extremely small faces in wide shots may not be detected
- Processing time increases with the number of faces detected
- Very old anime (pre-2000s) may have lower detection rates

## Future Improvements

Future updates to the stereOgram SBS Converter will include:

- Support for more diverse anime art styles
- Improved performance on older anime content
- Better handling of anime-specific visual elements (speed lines, effects, etc.)
- Integration with animation-specific temporal coherence for video processing
